[Character Name] - Handcuffs

=============================================================================
WHAT ARE HANDCUFFS?
=============================================================================

Behavioral constraints with gameplay consequences. Not punishments - texture.
These emerge from trauma, stress, and the gap between who they were and who
they're becoming.

Triggered by nightly roll based on violence, cumulative exposure, and
character-specific weights.
